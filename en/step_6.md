The mu software has been designed with young learners in mind. It has a very easy to use interface, and most of the menu items should be self-explanatory.

- The `New` button will open a *new* file. In mu this is done in a new tab. Have a go opening a few new files, and then closing them again.

- The `Load` button is for opening existing code that you have written.

- The `Save` button saves any work you have in the visible tab.

- The `Flash` button will push your code onto the micro:bit. You'll learn more about this later on.
