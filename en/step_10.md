## What next?

- As always, the best way of finding out how to use a new piece of hardware or software (in this case both) is to have a look at the documentation. You can find documentation for MicroPython on the micro:bit at [this site](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
- You could have a go at some of the other cool projects using a Raspberry Pi and a micro:bit. Have a look at the following resources:
- [micro:bit selfies](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/microbit-selfies)
- [micro:bit game controller](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/microbit-game-controller)
- [micro:bit meteorologist](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/microbit-meteorologist)
